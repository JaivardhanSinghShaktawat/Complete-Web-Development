------------------------------- Id And Classes -----------------------------------------

--> What is Id ? 
    It stands for unique identifier.It is used to identify an html element uniquely
    in the whole document so that we can select/target it to apply styles or manipulate 
    using JavaScript. 

    We can give only a single id name to a particular html element and it must be 
    unique in the whole web page.

    We use id attribute to give id name. 

    Ex : <p id = "para">It contains paragraph element</p>

    Id is also used to create hyperlink to some section or content. 

--> What is Class ? 
    Class is a group identifier.It is used to identify a single element or group of 
    elements.We can give multiple class names to a single html element as well as we 
    can give same class name to multiple html elements. 

    <p style = "background-color : #fff ; color : yellow;">Hello World</p>

    Ex : <div class = "container container-1">It is a container</div>
     <div class = "container container-2">It is a container</div>
     <div class = "container container-3">It is a container</div>
     <div class = "container container-4">It is a container</div>
     <div class = "container container-5">It is a container</div>
