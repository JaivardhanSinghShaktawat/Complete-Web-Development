/* 
------------------------------- Frontend Vs Backend -------------------------------

--> Frontend : Anything that happens on the client (browser) side. 

--> Backend : Anything that happens on the server side.

--> Frontend Development : The development of the code that is executed on the 
    client side is called as frontend development. 

--> Backend Development : The development of the code that is executed on the 
    server side is called as server development. 

--> What are Static Websites ? 
    These are those websites that are stored on the server and are send as it is 
    without any transformation and changes to the client as the response.No new 
    web page is created on the server , no data is fetched from the database.

    Static websites do not change frequently.

--> What are Dynamic Websites ? 
    These are those websites whose data changes very fast.These are those websites
    that are assembled and created on the server.A new web page is created on the
    server , data is fetched from the database and injected into the web page.
    For each and every request , a new web page is created on the server and than
    it is send to the client as a response.

--> What are Client Side Rendered Websites ? 
    They are render on the client side. 
    In CSR , a single html , css and javascript is send from the server to the 
    client , after which javascript takes control over the whole application.
    When user request for a new web page , than instead of making requests to the
    server , javascript renders a different component.

    All the Single Page Applications are called as Client Side Rendered Websites.

--> What are Server Side Rendered Websites ? 
    They are render on the server side.These websites are created and assembled
    on the server.A new page is created on the server , data is fetched from the
    database and injected into the web page and than the page is sent to the 
    client as a response.

--> How websites works ? 
    User makes a request through url via browser to the server.The server than 
    returns HTML , CSS and JavaScript Files.Browser parse these files and render
    them as web page.
    Behind the scenes ISP , DNS are also used to get the acutal IP address of the
    server. 

--> Why we map IP address with URL ? 
    It's very difficult to remember or memorize the IP address of different
    servers.That's why DNS maps them with url which is more human friendly and
    easier to remember.
